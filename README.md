# Crow-Attack
Top down, wave-based shooter 

I initially wanted to refine the game I had made earlier this semester, but instead decided to try recreating it in Unity. I haven't actually used much of C# before, so this task ended up being almost a little more than I could chew. 
I wanted it to make it Hitchcock inspired and decided to make the enemies crows. I got the crow sprite from https://mugenguild.com/forum/topics/the-crow-eric-draven-sprite-sheet-capcom-style-183880.0.html
It currently is not animated, though I would like to include that. I made the player asset using a free website (I forgot which but will try to find it) and used the forest tiles from Brackey's tutorials, which I also used to help me develop the Wave spawner. 
I would like to eventually create my own assets so that it will look like Hitchcock's The Birds, as well as add a splash screen that displays the highscore, powerups, and maybe even different levels.
